# Machine-Learning-Project-3

In this work two datasets are used, the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and the Bupa Liver Disease dataset to predict if a person has a benign or malinant tumor and to predict if a person has a liver disease or not respectively. 

We are implementing a two layer neural network with an input layer that is equal to the number of features in each dataset. Throughout this work, a number of different referneces were helpful when implementing the neural network and choosing on different hidden layer nodes and the nodes of the input layer.
